# Clustering-Algorithm-in-Machine-learning
Clustering Algorithm Assignment
This assignment explores the implementation and application of clustering algorithms, a key unsupervised learning technique in machine learning. The focus is on grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity, without prior labels. The assignment covers widely used clustering methods such as K-Means, where data is partitioned into a predefined number of clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance, and Hierarchical Clustering, which builds a tree-like structure of nested clusters. Tasks include preprocessing data, selecting optimal cluster numbers using techniques like the Elbow Method, visualizing clusters with tools like scatter plots, and analyzing the results to draw insights. Through this assignment, the importance of clustering in pattern recognition, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection is demonstrated.
